Purpose/Description: My capstone project is something I am deeply proud of. It is an active directory for my Fraternity. My Fraternity The Omega Psi Fraternity, Inc. is a service based organization founded on a campus of a Historically Black College Howard University in 1911. In addition to being pillars for our community our principles have been and remain to exemplify Manhood, Scholarship, Perserverance and upfilt. My chater specifically was the 4th oldest in the Fraternity and was chartered in 1919. With an organization with substantial history there are many outdated processes and systems. It is my endeavor to create an app that allows member to remain connected with one another and truly bring in the spirit of network and brotherhood.
