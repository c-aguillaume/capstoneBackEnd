Purpose/Description: My capstone project is something I am deeply proud of. It is an active directory for my Fraternity. My Fraternity The Omega Psi Fraternity, Inc. is a service based organization founded on a campus of a Historically Black College Howard University in 1911. In addition to being pillars for our community our principles have been and remain to exemplify Manhood, Scholarship, Perserverance and upfilt. My chater specifically was the 4th oldest in the Fraternity and was chartered in 1919. With an organization with substantial history there are many outdated processes and systems. It is my endeavor to create an app that allows member to remain connected with one another and truly bring in the spirit of network and brotherhood.


Steps/Process:

Phase 1: 
Overall Mission/Objectives:
Data Modeling
Repo + Folder Structure
Express Server Setup
MongoDb & Mongoose setup

I first created a capstone project for my file and 2 seperate files. One for the Backend and another for the Frontend. I also created an index.js file to intiially create a placeholder for my JavaScript and initialized node locally and later installed express, mongoose, cors, dotenv and a readme file. I also created a temporty memberSchema.js so I can visualize and model what I want the data to look like.

Phase 2: 
Frontend Setup + Displaying Members

Sorting, Filtering and more editing

Phase 4: 
Final Polish, Testing, and Presentation Prep
